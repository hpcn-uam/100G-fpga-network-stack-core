# 100 GbE UDP

This branch implements the Network layer of [VNx](https://github.com/Xilinx/xup_vitis_network_example), for the full stack (TCP) refer to the [master](https://github.com/hpcn-uam/100G-fpga-network-stack-core) branch

## Prerequisites

*Make sure that Vitis HLS is in the PATH and you are running a supported version*

- Vitis HLS 2021.1 or newer

If you are not sure what version is running execute the following command:

```
vitis_hls -version
```

## Getting Started

The makefile process is automated to target Virtex Ultrascale+ and Virtex Ultrascale+ HBM devices.

### Virtex Ultrascale+

Execute `make` in the root folder, a new folder named `synthesis_results_noHBM` will be created. After the folder creation the project will launch the Synthesis of the different IP-Cores. Be patient this may take around 10 minutes.

### Virtex Ultrascale+ HBM

Execute `make hbm` in the root folder, a new folder named `synthesis_results_HBM` will be created. After the folder creation the project will launch the Synthesis of the different IP-Cores. Be patient this may take around 10 minutes.

## Explore the IP-Cores

You can check the synthetized project under the folder `synthesis_results_noHBM` or `synthesis_results_HBM`. For instance, if you want to open the UDP IP

```
vivado_hls -p synthesis_results_HMB/UDP_prj/
```
